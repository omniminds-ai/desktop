A desktop application for contributing to the world's largest dataset for multimodal computer-use agents. Earn $VIRAL tokens in two ways: record your desktop interactions to train better computer-use AI, or provide secure virtual desktop infrastructure for deploying these agents. 

Built from the ground up with privacy and security as core principles. See our [Privacy Policy](PRIVACY.md) for details.

## Recording System

Our recording system is designed specifically for training powerful computer-use AI agents through data-driven approaches. Key features include:

### Quest System

- AI-generated quests, generated from random UI elements from thousands available on your screen

- Ensures diverse, instruction-following demonstration trajectories

- Structured with subobjectives to help AI models break down long trajectories into step-by-step plans

- Example quest shown above: creating a spreadsheet with specific requirements and subobjectives

### Recording Format

Recordings are two files and stored in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\ai.viralmind.desktop\recordings\` on Windows and `${HOME}/Library/Application Support/ai.viralmind.desktop/recordings/` on MacOS:

- .mp4 video capture

- .jsonl event log capturing detailed interaction data

Sample event log format:

```json
{"event":"quest_started","data":{"id":"spreadsheet_creation_01","title":"Create a New Spreadsheet","description":"Open Excel or Google Sheets and create a new spreadsheet with at least 3 columns and 5 rows of data","reward":10},"time":1738564880000}
